# The asset it prints is generated on a tag and downloaded by people who are not watching CI, so
# a wrong one is quiet twice over: it is valid YAML that `docker compose up` accepts, and the
# only symptom is a user compiling the player from source instead of pulling the image the
# release published. These run on every pull request, against the real docker-compose.yml, so
# that a change to that file which leaves nothing to substitute is caught by the pull request
# making it rather than by the next release.
#
# Needs: bash, diff, grep, cut and mktemp.
#
# Usage: scripts/compose_pinned_test.sh
